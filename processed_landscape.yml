              Hyperledger Besu is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases, with an
              extractable EVM implementation. It can also be run on test networks such as Sepolia and Görli. Hyperledger Besu includes several consensus
              algorithms including Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, and Proof of Authority (IBFT 2.0, QBFT, and Clique). Its comprehensive permissioning schemes
              are designed specifically for use in a consortium environment.

              Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed
              ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo. Indy is interoperable with other
              blockchains or can be used standalone powering the decentralization of identity.

            description: >-
              Hyperledger Sawtooth offers a flexible and modular architecture separates the core system from the application domain, so smart contracts can
              specify the business rules for applications without needing to know the underlying design of the core system. Hyperledger Sawtooth supports a
              variety of consensus algorithms, including Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET).

              Hyperledger Transact aims to reduce the development effort in writing distributed ledger software by providing a standard interface for executing
              smart contracts that is separate from the distributed ledger implementation. Hyperledger Transact takes an extensible approach to implementing new
              smart contract languages called “smart contract engines,” that implement a virtual machine or interpreter that processes smart contracts.

              Hyperledger Ursa is a shared cryptographic library, it enables implementations to avoid duplicating other cryptographic work and hopefully
              increase security in the process. The library is an opt-in repository (for Hyperledger and non Hyperledger projects) to place and use crypto.
              Hyperledger Ursa consists of sub-projects, which are cohesive implementations of cryptographic code or interfaces to cryptographic code.
