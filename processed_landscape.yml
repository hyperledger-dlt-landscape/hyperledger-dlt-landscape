              Hyperledger Besu is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases, with an
              extractable EVM implementation. It can also be run on test networks such as Sepolia and Görli. Hyperledger Besu includes several consensus
              algorithms including Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, and Proof of Authority (IBFT 2.0, QBFT, and Clique). Its comprehensive permissioning schemes
              are designed specifically for use in a consortium environment.

              Hyperledger Fabric is intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture. Hyperledger Fabric allows
              components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play.  Its modular and versatile design satisfies a broad range of industry
              use cases. It offers a unique approach to consensus that enables performance at scale while preserving privacy.

              Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed
              ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo. Indy is interoperable with other
              blockchains or can be used standalone powering the decentralization of identity.

              Hyperledger Sawtooth offers a flexible and modular architecture separates the core system from the application domain, so smart contracts can
              specify the business rules for applications without needing to know the underlying design of the core system. Hyperledger Sawtooth supports a
              variety of consensus algorithms, including Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET).
