              Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network by Ripple. Also called the Ripple Transaction
              Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol, it is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP
              (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable "secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no
              chargebacks." It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or
              mobile minutes. At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger, which uses a consensus process that allows for payments,
              exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.

              About us

              The American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) is a member-owned, non-profit national insurance advisory organization that provides
              specialized services to property/casualty insurers.


              More than 700 P/C insurers of all sizes throughout the U.S. use policy forms and/or rating information provided under more than 34 AAIS programs
              of personal, commercial, agricultural, and inland marine insurers.


              Long-known for its industry-leading inland marine and commercial output programs, AAIS in recent years has set new standards for innovation in
              agricultural property and liability coverage, and led the way in introducing the first advisory organization plan for rating homeowners policies
              by peril.


              In addition, AAIS is one of two licensed statistical agents operating nationally that collects P/C statistical information for meeting regulatory
              requirements and for developing loss costs for use in rating policies.


              In 2013, AAIS made a substantial new departure by launching its "Underwriting Platform,"​ a cloud-based application for underwriting and rating
              policies and capturing information during the quote process. "UP"​ has been developed to support AAIS's industry-leading Commercial Output Program
              and key classes of its Inland Marine Guide. In coming months and years, it will be deployed to support all AAIS programs.


              AAIS was created in the mid-1970s as the successor organization to a former inland marine rating bureau and continues to operate under a
              commitment to preserve competition in bureau services for P/C carriers.


              AAIS is currently led by Edmund J. Kelly, president and CEO, who came to AAIS in 2012 after years of experience in organizations that provided
              professional liability and property catastrophe insurance.

              The Bank of England, formerly the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which
              most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world and the world's 8th oldest bank.
              It was established to act as the English Government's banker, and is still the banker for HM Government. The Bank was privately owned by
              stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until nationalized in 1946. In 1998, it became an independent public organization, wholly owned by the
              Treasury Solicitor on behalf of the government, with independence in setting monetary policy. The Bank is one of eight banks authorized to issue
              banknotes in the United Kingdom, but has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales and regulates the issue of banknotes by
              commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. They are headquartered in London, England.

              The ETC Cooperative (the “ECC”) was created to financially support the growth and development of Ethereum Classic by funding three key aspects of
              the ETC ecosystem: development, marketing, and community.


              Aid development by filling in gaps where projects are out of scope for our development teams and providing funding to projects that community
              members want to create.


              Improve marketing by communicating ETC’s message and helping newcomers understand the strengths of ETC’s open and decentralized nature.


              Foster community by making sure the various resources the community uses are well stewarded; this includes websites, social media, forums, and
              documentation.

              The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the
              increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in
              applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war
              defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in
              1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. The Institute is traditionally known for its research
              and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. It is often
              cited as among the world's top universities. The "Engineers" sponsor 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England
              Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.
